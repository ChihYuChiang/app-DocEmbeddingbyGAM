# Project Proposal

## Introduction
How can subjective experiences be logically portrayed? For experience-intensive products, such as video games, where graphic quality, game specifications, and traditional metrics are deficient in illustrating the diverse gaming experiences players seek for. Game genres (first-person shooters, role-playing, puzzles, etc.) may serve as one simplistic manner of categorizing video games. However, they capture only a superficial form of the gameplay and are hardly indicative 
of the rich depth of in-game experiences that one may be exposed to as a player. In this project, I propose a new analytical scheme that describes product experiences through critique reviews. It utilizes a clustering model and a generative adversarial Neural Net, employing video games and their review articles as a demonstration. It provides quality measures of abstract product experiences in an objective and cost-effective way.

## Data and Explorative results
To show that the critique review texts contains information of the corresponding video game experience, a survey is conducted with 50 core games, hand-picked popular titles, through Amazon Mechanical Turk (MTurk). With 350 participants, it collects 6,990 experiential resemblances in a triplet form—the relative similarity of game A to B and to C. These triplet-resemblances are built into a triplet embedding via the t-Distributed Stochastic Triplet Embedding (t-STE), where distances between each game preserve the similarity of the games’ experiences. 
Based on where they locate in this embedding space, the core games are clustered into seven clusters by the Ward algorithm, each denoting a potential video game experiential genre.
 
On the other hand, an expert review corpus is compiled from articles of three major game information websites, GameSpot, GamesRadar, and Polygon. The corpus includes 15,727 English reviews, covering 11,724 unique games in the last four decades, and amasses a total of 15-million words of analysis. It is then applied with the Word2Vec (W2V) algorithm to provide a 300-dimensional space that representing semantic similarities between words apropos of linguistic conventions of the general video gaming field.

A simple Neural Net (MLP) is applied, using the game reviews of the 15k games to predict their identities of the seven experience genres generated from the clustering on the survey data.
The result is projected with t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding (t-SNE) as shown in the plot. From the geographical separation of the colors, we gain superficial insights into the quality of using the review texts in describing the product experiences. The observations’ projected locations successfully capture the genre structure represented by the colors, and the randomly selected games (tagged in the plot) are generally distributed according to their experience similarity. For example, LIMBO and Deponia both describe an abandoned, demolished world; Anno 2070, Prison Architect, and Skylanders Imaginators all stress on the creativity element. These patterns are not perfect, but they indicate the potential of extracting the product experience features from the review text data--what this project intends to achieve.

Once the features are identified, they can be presented visually and interactively to help customers find the games providing similar experiences of the games they like, and to help businesses explore similar products on the market, facilitating their product design and development. Moreover, it is possible to acquire the similarities between the feature vectors of each game, denoting the experience similarities between the game items. This similarity information then can be used in product recommendation for businesses selling multiple products, such as Amazon, when it recommends books or videos to a customer based on his/her purchasing/preference history of other books. (Note, the app is meant to be a demonstration of an interactive presentation of experience features. The features presented in the app is not the same as the clusters defined in Plot 1.)

## Main process
The primary objective of this project is to identify meaningful and descriptive features for each item (video game) by the corresponding review texts. The features are able to be defined by the clusters discovered in the explorative section. They have already presented meaningful insights about the items' experiences. However, clustering based on the plain document vectors (from the plain W2V) could confound the clustering results by involving unrelated information in the process. To further refine the quality of the features, a generative adversarial model (GAM) is proposed.
 
The GAM provides a primary benefit of saving specially designed and acquired human inputs. Multiple Neural Nets in a GAM help each other in defining the costs and therefore guiding the training process of each other. In supervised machine learning problems, the cost computation traditionally depends on those specifically acquired, costly human contributions, such as the true tags produced by human judges in object identification tasks.
 
The GAM proposed in this project incorporates two shallow Neural Network models to acquire a document embedding fine-tuned for better describing the product experiences. The raw texts are first processed into a word embedding via the W2V algorithm. Accepting word vectors of a particular video game's review texts as the input, the first Neural Net employs a recurrent model and output N unique words representative of the underlying video game. The second Neural Net takes the output words from the first model and the word vectors of the particular game's review texts as its input. The output words of the first model include the words representing this particular video game and the words representing a similar game in the same genre or cluster, generated by the first model. The second model incorporates a recurrent layer to produce the coveted document embedding (the product experience features) and a fully connected layer to output binary judgments if a representative word represents this particular game (false if it represents the similar game). The second model's cost increases when a right word (from this particular game) is identified as false (not from this game) and a wrong word (from a similar game) is identified as true (from this game). The output of the second model is then be sent back to the first model to define the first model's cost, which is increased if, in the second model, the right word is identified as false. In a nutshell, the first model commits to producing representative words as representative as possible for the underlying games, as the second model forces the first model to consider only those words which distinguish the underlying game from a game with a similar experience. As a result, the document embedding in the second model comprises the features which tell the differences in the experience between the games.
 
One potential threat to this approach is the instability of the GAMs. As the GAM technique is still developing and not fully matured at this point, there is no guarantee the model could lead to a stable mathematical solution. A mindful initialization utilizing the pre-trained, plain-version word and document embeddings could help alleviate the problem, while no way to tell with assurance. Nevertheless, the potential benefit of the GAM makes it worth a try. If the GAM does not work out, the features from the clustering in the explorative phase can still be used.
 
## Expected outcome
This project employs clustering and the GAM to identify experiential elements of a video game from a linguistic construct. The project develops universal experience measures for video game experiences, which are quantifiable and cost-effective as less human judgments are involved. These characteristics allow a more objective and effective understanding of customer preferences and, based upon that, better products or product recommendations a business could provide to their customers.
 
As for communicating the results, the identified features will be illustrated by their relationship with experiential concepts, such as human emotions, happy, sorrow, or alike, in the plain word embedding space. The relationships can be represented as scores and presented interactively, as showcased in the app of the Plot 2. The app was developed and are currently hosted by Shiny R, and will be hugely improved by porting to the Heroku platform to utilize Neural Net frameworks in other languages, such as Python, and better visual presentations by native Javascript libraries.
